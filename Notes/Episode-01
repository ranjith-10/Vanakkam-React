CDN - Content Delivery Network
   CDN is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end-users.
   CDN allows quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet.
   Eg - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Image, Video.

To Start a Basic React App, we need to inject CDN React Links that we get in a script tag.
  2 script link for React are 
        React - It is the Core react.
        ReactDOM - It is injected to use react in Browser.
    After injecting the script tag, now the project will understand React.

Cross-Origin :
    Cross-Origin is a HTML attribute set.
    Provides Support for CORS.
    Used to define how the element handles cross-origin request.
   
CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    Used to load resources other than its own medium.

React.createElement(tag, attribute set, children) :
    CreateElement is nothing but an Object.
    CreateElement Object contains props which have attributes & children.
    Multiple childrens can be added by wrapping the children into an array [].
    
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
    createRoot is used to get the root element where the createelement is to appended.
    Root will replace all the existing root tag in the HTML.
    React will work only iside the root rest will work as HTML.
    
Render is used to read the react element object and conver it into Browser understandable HTML tags.
